Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week.

Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives. Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday. In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.' Khan had announced a fight with Chris Algieri next month but he has now backtracked on that, claiming that there are 'some more options on the table'. Khan has now denied that he will face Chris Algieri next month, claiming there are 'some more options' Chris Algieri lost every round to Manny Pacquiao when he took on the Filipino star last November. Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June. A \u00a35million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak. Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names. 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money.

Mayall, who played scheming Tory MP Alan B\u2019Stard in ITV series The New Statesman, and a host of other comedy characters, died suddenly aged 56 last June. But probate records reveal he had no will \u2013 even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad-bike accident in 1998 \u2013 which could mean complications for his wife of 29 years, Barbara, and their three adult children. Scroll down for video. Legacy: Rik Mayall is pictured in 1999 with his wife Barbara and their children after his quad bike accident. His estate could be liable for tax of tens of thousands of pounds which would not have been payable if he had left everything to his wife. Lawyers have always advised that people should have a valid will to avoid tax pitfalls. Mayall, one of the leading \u2018alternative\u2019 comics of the 1980s, surprised doctors by making a good recovery after his accident and returned to work in 1999, but he developed epilepsy and took daily medication. Rik Mayall (pictured) died suddenly aged 56 last June. His personal estate would be divided according to Government intestacy rules, which take into account marital status, children or surviving relatives. Andrew Kidd, a specialist probate solicitor and partner in London law firm Clintons, said that Mayall\u2019s children would be automatically entitled to a share of his net estate of \u00a31,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses, meaning they could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax. But Mr Kidd said the amount of any tax payable would depend on the value of Mayall\u2019s chattels or personal belongings which would go to his wife under intestacy rules. Mr Kidd said that the rules for a married father like Mayall meant his wife would be due to receive \u00a3250,000 plus all his \u2018chattels\u2019, which would include any personally owned cars, furniture, ornaments, books and jewellery. By law, Mayall\u2019s children would then automatically get half the remaining value of the estate, creating a potential tax bill if the amount is more than the inheritance tax limit of \u00a3325,000. Mayall\u2019s widow would have received a life interest in the remaining half \u2013 meaning she could not touch or transfer that money but could claim interest on it. Mr Kidd added that Mayall\u2019s family could seek to avoid the tax by drawing up a deed of variation to split up his estate, reducing any sum left to the children so it was below the tax threshold. Mrs Mayall declined to discuss the estate and the apparent lack of a will. At her home in South-West London she said: \u2018I haven\u2019t heard anything from my lawyers yet.\u2019 How the (Tory-hating) geniuses behind Alan B\u2019Stard helped David Cameron into No 10. He's the man behind the most roguish Tory MP of all \u2013 the arrogant, preening Alan B\u2019Stard, star of the hit television comedy The New Statesman. Yet writer Laurence Marks also played a crucial role in getting David Cameron into Downing Street, it can be revealed. In the 1990s, Mr Marks lived in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, where Mr Cameron would later become MP. He and his writing partner Maurice Gran had become local celebrities owing to the success of The New Statesman, which ran from 1987 to 1994. Roguish: Rik Mayall as Alan B'Stard in the comedy The New Statesman. David Cameron is pictured right. Although Marks was a committed Labour supporter and Gran was a Liberal Democrat, the then chairman of the local Conservative Association, Joyce Sanderson, sought their views on who should contest the seat for the Tories at the 1997 General Election. Against their advice, Witney Conservatives went for the one option the pair strongly advised against \u2013 Shaun Woodward. He would cause a political storm two years after being elected as an MP by defecting to Labour. So next time the seat came up for grabs, the opinions of Mr Marks and Mr Gran were clearly more respected. When they were introduced to all five on the shortlist to fight Witney at the 2001 Election, they plumped for an ambitious young man called David Cameron, who won the seat with a majority of nearly 8,000. \u2018When they selected Woodward, I told them, \u201cYou\u2019re making a dreadful mistake,\u201d said Mr Marks, 66, last night. \u2018Out of the five they introduced to us the next time around, David Cameron was by far the best. 'He was very bright and understood things but we never guessed he would be Prime Minister. Joyce knew my political views but she thought it was good to have an outside opinion. I\u2019m a member of the Labour Party but I admire certain Tories, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have created Alan B\u2019Stard. \u2018David Cameron is a lovely fellow \u2013 a really nice man. He used to come to my place for tea with his wife Samantha. We\u2019ve remained friends.

They carried duffel bags, plastic bags full of clothes and small suitcases. They'd already abandoned larger bags in a mound. Only carry-on luggage was allowed on this Air India plane. The passengers were mostly Indian nationals, plus Yemenis and people from other countries who had been working in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. They sprinted or walked with deliberation to the airplanes. The stress of living in a war zone showed on the passengers' faces. Nobody wanted to be left behind. They climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the Air India crew, all wearing pressed uniforms, the flight attendants fully made up. After takeoff, the flight attendants went up and down the aisle offering drinks to the 188 evacuees as if they were on a vacation flight. But some passengers were already fast asleep, exhausted by the push to get out of Yemen, site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Mideast. This scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of Sanaa during a small window when Saudi planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the Houthis, a Shiite group that has taken over the capital. Air India is especially active because so many Indian nationals work in other nations. Over the last few days, India has evacuated some 2,500 people from Yemen, said Gen. Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister who's overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, the small African nation nearly 430 kilometers (267 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats at port cities such as Aden. People are leaving behind much more than luggage. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, lived in the capital 34 years and built a life there. He loved living in Yemen. \"I never felt like a foreigner,\" he said. Like the others, he was exhausted and jangled by the shelling and lack of electricity for long stretches. \"At night, my goodness!\" he said. \"Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad.\" The Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But the Saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. The loading of passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- another touch of normalcy in the otherwise abnormal event. They didn't  pay for the flight, though they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. \"Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,\" Thakur said."], "reference": ["Air India has evacuated 2,500 people in recent days from Yemen, Indian official says.

The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), are based on a study of about 95,000 young people. All those in the study had older siblings. Some of the elder children had autism and some did not. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Since autism can run in families, researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism. They found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk, whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed. 'Consistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk among privately insured children,' said the study, led by Anjali Jain, a doctor in Falls Church, Virginia. 'We also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD.' Autism is on the rise, and affects as many as one in 68 children in the United States, but its causes remain poorly understood. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield. He was later stripped of his medical license. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield that purported to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in 12 children. It was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted by the journal that published it. As the author, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. But concerns over vaccine safety, particularly in the Internet age, have proven difficult to quell. 'Although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD, parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with ASD,' said the JAMA study. 'Surveys of parents who have children with ASD suggest that many believe the MMR vaccine was a contributing cause.' Children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated, the study found. The MMR vaccination rate for the children with unaffected siblings was 92 percent by age five. In contrast, the MMR vaccination rates for children with older siblings with ASD was 86 percent by age five. An accompanying editorial by Bryan King, a doctor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, said the data is clear. 'The only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism,' King wrote. 'Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.'"], "reference": ["The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are based on a study of about 95,000 young people.

The suffering of Jalila - whose name has been changed - is just one of a number of harrowing accounts given by women who have escaped captured by the brutal Islamist organisation which is taking over swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. The study undertaken by Human Rights Watch\u00a0found fighters were kidnapping women and children as young as eight, forcing them to marry and convert to Islam and raping them repeatedly \u2013 sometimes picking their victims\u2019 names out of a hand in a sick lottery. Scroll down for video. Yazidi women and girls have been separated from their families, forced to convert to Islam and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters, the study from Human Rights Watch says. Their actions amount to war crimes. it adds. Yazidi children as young as eight have been abducted from their homes in northern Iraq, raped by ISIS fighters and forced into marriage. One child interviewed said she was 'owned' and raped by seven different men. Of those who managed to escape, many feel suicidal after their traumatic ordeal and need better medical and psychological support, says Human Rights Watch. Some tried to kill themselves while in captivity to avoid rape. Their terrifying campaign of systematic rape was tantamount to war crimes - and possibly crimes against humanity, the report adds. Jalila,who managed to escape her tormentors, told the charity she was taken with seven members of her family when Arab men stormed her village north of Sinjar in August 2014. After a few weeks she was taken to a house in Syria that housed other abducted young Yazidi women and girls, where the men would come and select us. She was selected by an ISIS fighter, who slapped her and dragged her from the house when she resisted him. The names of Yazidi women were selected from a lottery for men to rape, a survivor told the charity. \u2018I told him not to touch me and begged him to let me go\u2019, she said. \u2018I was a young girl, and I asked him, \u2018What do you want from me?\u2019 He spent three days having sex with me.\u2019 During her captivity seven ISIS fighters \u2018owned\u2019 Jalila, and four raped her on multiple occasions. Human Rights Watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from ISIS, which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery and forced marriage \u2013 acts that constitute war crimes. A 12-year-old girl (not pictured) told investigators she was raped for three days by a brutal Islamist militant. Another victim told Human Rights Watch how she had tried to kill herself so that she wouldn't be raped again. Rape and other forms of sexual violence committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war. These women were part of a group of 216 Yazidis who were recently released by ISIS after being captured last year. The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report in March describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators. Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'. Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.' She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority.

Rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the ISIS fighters who had captured her. \u2018Later that day they made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names', the 31-year-old said. \u2018The man who selected me, Abu Ghufran, forced me to bathe but while I was in the bathroom I tried to kill myself. \u2018I had found some poison in the house, and took it with me to the bathroom.

{"question_id": 278, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: A husband accused of trying to murder his cheating wife wrote her an extraordinary letter while remanded in prison asking her to send him a suit for his trial, a court heard yesterday. Joseph O'Riordan, 73, stabbed his 47-year-old wife Amanda eight times after he discovered she had been having an affair with a postman. She was left with life-threatening injuries to her torso, chest, arms and back. Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times. O'Riordan, who was a councillor at the time, rang an ambulance after the attack in October last year and admitted what he had done during the 999 call. Yesterday it emerged that four months later, while on remand, O'Riordan wrote to his wife from jail asking her to 'get my things together' before for his trial. Meanwhile Mrs O'Riordan, during questioning by her husband's defence team in court yesterday, sobbed: 'I did not want to hurt Joe. I never wanted to hurt him\u2026 even now. All of this is my fault because I had an affair.' In the letter, which was posted from prison on February 4 this year, O'Riordan asked his wife to gather some of his belongings and give them to his son, including a 'decent jumper' and his 'beige casual jacket'. He also asked for his 'blue suit' and 'three ties that will go with the suit', which he said he needed for the trial. His letter went on: 'You will be fully aware that I cannot make any mention of the case. 'I hope and pray that your recovery continues to progress and you will always remain in my heart \u2013 God bless, Joe.' O'Riordan sobbed as the letter was read out at Brighton Crown Court yesterday. His wife also broke down in the witness box as she gave evidence from behind a screen. The case was adjourned for 90 minutes to give Mrs O'Riordan time to regain her composure. Prosecutor Dale Sullivan asked if she had been expecting the letter and she replied: 'No \u2013 I wasn't expecting anything from him.' Earlier, video footage of a pre-recorded police interview with Mrs O'Riordan was played to the court, in which she described her husband as 'passionate and vocally volatile' but said he had never 'laid a finger on her before.' She said she thought he might have suffered from 'mild depression' because he could be 'up one minute and down the next'. During later questioning by O'Riordan's defence counsel Peter Doyle QC, she said she and her husband were 'soulmates'. The couple, from Polegate, East Sussex, met in 1991 and had been married for ten years at the time of the attack, the court heard. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard that four months after attack, while on remand, O'Riordan wrote to his wife from jail asking her to 'get my things together' before for his trial. But Mrs O'Riordan said that last year she felt 'smothered' by her husband and wanted 'more me time.' This was the 'trigger' for her brief affair with postman Nicholas Gunn, who has since moved away from the area. 'It was not something I had ever done before,' she told the court. O'Riordan found out about the affair after hiring a private detective to follow her. He had also asked his friends to watch her. The jury heard that a row had developed between the pair on October 22 while they were visiting Mrs O'Riordan's mother after O'Riordan received a phone call, believed to be from Mr Gunn. Mrs O'Riordan said they then went to a KFC restaurant and in the car on the way home her husband became angry and she tried to get out, but was 'dragged' back and held down. Once the couple were home, she said her husband came into their bedroom brandishing a kitchen knife as he cried: 'You have made me do this. This is all your fault.' Mrs O'Riordan also said that just days before the assault her husband had talked of 'finishing her off and then himself'. She added: 'I just thought that was talk as it was not said in anger. I never read anything into it. It was not said with malice but it was said maybe a week before he attacked me.' O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council, East Sussex, at the time. He was also president of his local Royal British Legion and was invited to the Queen's garden party in 2013 for helping to arrange parts of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

{"question_id": 279, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: The UK is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer-stricken five-year-old Ashya King made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment. Cardiff-based Proton Partners International Ltd, is to open the treatment centres, which will be available to NHS cancer patients, in Cardiff, London and Northumberland by 2017, with the first in the Welsh capital being operational by next year. The announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer Ashya told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in Prague. Scroll down for video. Five-year-old Ashya King, pictured in October, who suffered from brain cancer but has recently been given the all-clear after receiving proton beam therapy. Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy, which Ashya, pictured, received. Both Brett and Naghmeh King sparked an international manhunt last year after taking their son out of hospital in Southampton, without doctors' consent. Mr and Mrs King had wanted their son to have the cutting-edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain before travelling to the Czech Republic to the Proton Therapy Centre. Now, a group called Proton Partners International has now been formed in the UK following discussions between Professor Sir Chris Evans, the life sciences entrepreneur and UK life sciences and healthcare investors. They have committed almost \u00a3100million equity finance into the company. Professor Gordon McVie, senior consultant at the European Institute of Oncology, has been appointed chairman of the group, and Professor Karol Sikora has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company, alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts. Ashya, with his parents Brett and\u00a0Naghmeh. The Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. Professor McVie said: 'This is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the UK. As things stand, patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment, often at great expense to the NHS. 'The creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the UK.' While Sir Chris added: 'We are delighted that the UK's first centre will be based in Cardiff and Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund is proud to support this breakthrough. While conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells, often damaging surrounding tissue, proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour. Because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. While radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function, proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects. This means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas, such as brain cancer. However, Cancer Research UK estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known. The only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer NHS Foundation Trust in the Wirral, Merseyside, which delivers 'low energy' therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The NHS currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment. They must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment. More than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of \u00a3100,000 per patient. 'There are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the UK and the demand for treatment is growing. 'It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017. Proton Partners will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the UK as of next year.' In addition to state of the art Proton Partners' treatment services, the Cardiff centre will provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and supportive care. Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects. The Government has announced that it is to create two NHS proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. However, despite the treatment and his recovery, Ashya's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the UK, his grandmother said last month."], "reference": ["The three centres are planned for Cardiff, London and Northumberland.

Managers from the London Ambulance Service, the largest in the NHS, have just filled 225 vacant posts with applicants from Sydney and Melbourne. They were recruited on the back of a series of practical demonstrations on dummies, a written exam and an interview that lasted in all between four and six hours. Ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500-mile round trip to Australia to hire paramedics on \u00a34,500 \u2018golden hello\u2019 payments. The selection process, held at five-star hotels, was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job. It is the latest example of how the NHS is recruiting overseas because it has failed to train enough staff in Britain to meet the needs of the rising and ageing population. Hospital managers have been flying out to Spain and Portugal to hire batches of 30 nurses at a time. The ambulance service is also severely understaffed and, across England, around 1,250 posts are unfilled \u2013 a tenth of what is needed. The Mail attended a fast-track recruitment event last month at the five-star Sydney Harbour Marriott Hotel, overlooking the famous Opera House. Our investigation discovered how:. Growing numbers of paramedics are quitting the NHS. Many are frustrated at having to spend hours queuing outside A&E units which are too full to accept their patients. They are also being called out to a growing number of non-urgent calls from patients unable to see a GP. The selection process, held at five-star hotels, was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job. The increasing demand on ambulances means they are taking longer to reach the seriously ill. As a result, many paramedics are choosing to take up posts as \u2018advanced practitioners\u2019 in A&E, GP surgeries and call centres for the 111 helpline where the work is less stressful and they can earn more. London Ambulance Service has been the hardest hit by this exodus. Currently 340 posts are vacant, a fifth of the total workforce needed. Last year alone more than 230 paramedics quit. However, Australia has a surplus.Other understaffed ambulance services in the UK are also going abroad, including to Poland. As well as the 225 paramedics hired from Australia last month, London Ambulance Service hired 175 from there and New Zealand in September. Managers are considering flying out again later this year and calculate that the first recruitment drive saved the NHS \u00a39million. It costs \u00a350,000 to train one paramedic in Britain. Each trip to Australia costs the ambulance service \u00a390,000 in flights and hotel bills, but they return having hired on average 200 paramedics. They are offered a \u00a330,200 salary including London weighting. Jason Killens, director of operations at London Ambulance Service, said: \u2018It\u2019s not our long-term solution but is helping us fill a skills shortage while we train more people to become paramedics in the UK.\u2019 He said the paramedics had initially been filtered via an online form. Tim Jones is one of the many Australians being lured to Britain to work as a paramedic. He will join the London Ambulance Service when he finishes his degree course in October. The 22-year-old said it was \u2018exciting helping people\u2019, but also hopes it will enable him to see more of Europe.
